        <p>Hi</p><br>
            <p class="article-text"><span style="font-size: 25px;">Another Year- 2024</span><br>Friends- and friends not that I mourn over- It is another year. Millions have died before its coming and millions more have been born to see it come. As fast as the days go- years go just as well. And so again with the new year, we are reminded of our temporary stature as the count ticks. How different things were years ago and how different they can be years later. More importantly, how soon our years will no longer be; as for old age, or a more likely unexpected death. One man may be in the grave as another spills tears over him this year; though all will have their place in these two roles.<strong> As an end is certain for all things earthly</strong>- even the mountains are brought back to sand; and the castle towns of old are long in ruins, voices no longer heard within them.</p>
