[Intro] 
So… This is a weird video. We will discuss the new drama that's been going on at Mineplex and my recent ban reasons. (Pan in Discord Ban, LGTBQ drama, and Forum ban)<br><br>

First off, I will be discussing the recent drama that's been happening in the discord, and forums, and how it led to my recent bans. Ok, so we all know that June is Woke Pride Month and every single company is making their logo into some rainbow variation. Well, Mineplex followed. There have been a lot of discussions on the discord (show discord images) and the forums (show forums discussion) and Mineplex has taken a bias. I have been against the pride logo and ever since the community and staff have been super rude and disrespectful towards me just for having an opinion. Staff members have called me a Racist Bigot *cough cough SpamL*. (show SPAML rude image). Due to the staff being biased, my posts got deleted on the forums AND the discord. I ended up getting muted for 7 days on the discord for discrimination. Also, as a lot of you know, the famous hacker known as “COWUH” apparently “canceled” me for being “Homophobic” and a “Transphobic Racist”. The video has over 300 views and now thanks to her, I get barnbarted with rudeness in-game LOL! My group and I made a whole document on the situation and the documentation of staff rudeness, I will put it in the pinned comment and the description of the video. <br><br>

Let’s go into why I was banned from the discord. A day after the LGBTQ discussion. I had an excellent discussion about the YouTube algorithm and how Mineplex punishes its users for no reason and doesn't punish users who do wrong. Roughly 5 hours after that small discussion, I was PERMANENTLY BANNED for the unprofessional ban message of “Only here to cause drama/troll” for permanent. I didn't even say anything ban-worthy or anything that would be deemed to be trolling. Here are the last couple of messages that I said. (Show past messages).<br><br>

Ok, so let’s go into my forum ban. I was banned on 6/25/22 for reaching 8 warning points. I will now discuss every warning in detail. My first warning on 5/30/22 was a 3-point warning on a YouTube video post called Greymoon 32x. I was given the 3-point warning because the song in the background of the video said “bitch”. This is exaggerated because it's just 1 word that plays in the song. The following 3-point warning was on another YouTube post on the video “Mineplex Slander”. The warning reason was for “inappropriate content”, which the video doesn't have. There is some staff bias going on in the server. Even COWUH agrees that there is some biassing going on in Mineplex.  Now for the final warning, and the reason for my ban. I was ranting on my wall. I got a 2-point warning for “staff Reversal”. That means I now had 8 points, which is a perm ban. What did I reverse? What was so bad? The staff hate me for not being a liberal and give me warnings, mutes, and bans for no reason.<br><br>

Now I will never get YT rank lol. Well, I learned a few things from this: You must always be a liberal on Mineplex, and Mineplex is fucking shit. <br><br>

**Doge from the future here, They banned me on the bedrock server for Aimbot. Fuck you, Mineplex.
