   <!-- Note -->
      <center><p class="article-text" style="font-size: 15px;"><i>This was an letter that a few friends and acquaintances wrote back in June in protest of Mineplex changing its logo to a pride logo. The following text is unchanged, and I tried my best to format this document verbatim. I also added images for better context, I attempted to upload all images to my website for future reference. Please note, that this article may not reflect current events, and the people in this article may no longer be in the community or are no longer active. ~ WarRobotDoge 4/8/22</i></p></center><br><br>
        
            <p class="article-text"><strong>1.</strong>  While I do not have an issue with people who are of the LGBTQ community, I believe when Mineplex is consistently saying we are a family-friendly network, Mineplex keeps that standard, as that is what kept it on such a high pedestal for so long. When I first saw that Mineplex put the flag, I initially reacted to CookieBilly about how that is not family-friendly, and to my surprise, many staff members & community members started to aggressively target me due to this belief. I was trying to stay civil in this debate, but the staff and many alike were aggressive & just telling me to leave because I was an oppressor. Dean, I hope you understand that I do not hate this group, but that kids should not be exposed to this as it is not just immoral, it goes against the Mineplex code. I will include multiple screenshots of what is to be considered inappropriate by Mineplex & generally, this also includes a discussion where people are talking about Gay sex & aids!</p><br><br>

            <p class="article-text"><strong>2.</strong>  I do find that while it is not as taboo for this topic as it once was, it is still inappropriate for kids to play & then have this taught to them when they just want to play Dragon Escape. Your staff members repeatedly admit that Bedrock is largely a very young audience, it is very inappropriate to talk to a 7-year-old about any topic about sex unless you are the parent of the child, adults should not be interacting like that. Adults doing this are considered groomers, pedophiles, and many more unpleasant words, I imagine if you had a child and overheard the teacher talking to them about sexual nature or about their intimate relationships, straight or gay, I am sure you would have a problem with an adult talking to a minor about sex.</p><br><br>
            
            
               <p class="article-text"><strong>3.</strong>  Mineplex should be neutral and non-political no matter what. In many religions, such as Christianity, pride is a sin and is not to be discussed, let alone changing the server logo to one of the biggest political movements in history. The server should always be unbiased at all costs. Why are we forced to believe your political beliefs? We all have the right to have an opinion, we do not want or need to know it, especially for a kids' server. We do not care if you support LGTB or not, we just don't want you to shove it down OUR throats! Why is there a pride logo but no flag the Memorial Day? Those warriors got SPIT ON! They get 1 lousy day and these low-live, mentally distraught people get 2 whole months for doing nothing. A further point, if you are offended by these bad words, imagine how it would be when kids hear about gay sex!
