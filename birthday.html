Those beautiful blue eyes behind your glasses...they just pull me in. I love the way your hair shows your face, and that necklace adds such a sweet touch (boobies >.<). You’re so effortlessly gorgeous, even just chilling, especially when you're pouty tho. And those boobs? Damn, babygirl, they always take my breath away. You look like a queen here, just as I always see you. How could I not ask for more photos when you look this perfect? I love you.

            <center><p>Happy Birthday, Jess!

I just need you to know how unbelievably special you are to me. Every single day, you light up my life and bring me more happiness than I ever thought possible. You’re not just gorgeous, you’re the most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen, inside and out :3. I love everything about you, your stunning blue eyes that make time stop when I look into them, your smile, your sweet voice, and the way you always manage to bring joy into my life with just a giggle, sweet word, or a picture of you.<br><br>

You’re so much more than just beautiful, you’re the most thoughtful, loving, and caring person I’ve ever met. From the little things like sending me photos to hearing you sing, you constantly remind me how lucky I am to have you. You’ve made such a massive impact on my life, and I can’t help but daydream about our future together. Every moment with you feels like a dream, and I’m so proud to call you my girlfriend, and one day my wife. I can’t wait to see you in that gorgeous dress as my queen.<br><br>

Jess, you’ve overcome so much this past year, and I am endlessly fucking proud of you. I’m so thankful for everything you do, from your sweet gestures to your incredible talent and passion. You make me the happiest man in the world, and I feel so lucky to have you in my life. You’re everything to me, my love, my best friend, my comfort, my babybookworm. I’ll do anything for you because you mean the absolute world to me.<br><br>

I love you so much, Jess. You’re perfect just the way you are, and I wouldn’t change a single thing about you. I can't wait to live your mid-30s (YOUNG, grr) with you, and I can't wait till I can hold you in my arms. But until then, I want you to know that I’m always thinking of you, dreaming of our life together, and loving you more with every passing day.<br><br>

Happy birthday, Jess. You deserve the world.<br><br>

"Don't weeeaaaave me",
Your Baby Boy
